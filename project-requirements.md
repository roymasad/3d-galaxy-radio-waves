Okay, let's transform that description into a formal App Requirement Scope Document.  This document will be structured to be clear, concise, and actionable for development.

**App Requirement Scope Document: Radio Wave Propagation Simulation**

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for a Python-based application that visually simulates the propagation of radio waves in a theoretical galaxy.  The application will use the Kivy framework for the graphical user interface (GUI) and will allow users to customize various simulation parameters.  The primary goal is to visualize radio wave propagation and estimate the probability of detecting extraterrestrial signals.

**2. Goals**

*   Visually simulate the propagation of radio waves from stars within a 3D galaxy model.
*   Allow users to customize the simulation parameters through a user-friendly GUI.
*   Calculate and display the number of radio waves that intersect a designated "Earth" star.
*   Estimate the probability of detecting extraterrestrial signals based on user-defined parameters.
*   Provide a clear and intuitive user experience.

**3. Target Audience**

This application is intended for users interested in:

*   Astronomy and astrophysics
*   Radio wave propagation
*   The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI)
*   Educational demonstrations of scientific concepts

**4. Functional Requirements**

**4.1. Simulation Engine**

*   **Galaxy Model:**
    *   The galaxy will be modeled as a 3D "saucer" shape (ellipsoid).  Detailed spiral arm structures are not required.
    *   Default galaxy diameter: 1000 light-years.
    *   Default number of stars: 100.
    *   Stars will be randomly distributed within the galaxy's volume.  A uniform random distribution is acceptable.
*   **Star Properties:**
    *   Each star will have a randomly assigned position within the galaxy.
    *   Each star will have a defined lifespan (see input parameters).
    *   A subset of stars will be designated as "radio-emitting."
    *   Radio-emitting stars will generate radio waves only during specific, short intervals of their lifetime (see input parameters).
*   **Radio Wave Propagation:**
    *   Radio waves will be represented as expanding 3D translucent spheres.
    *   The spheres will expand at a constant speed (representing the speed of light, scaled for the simulation).
    *   The spheres will continue to expand until the end of the simulation or until they exceed the boundaries of the display area (whichever comes first; there's no need to track waves that leave the visible galaxy).
*   **Earth Representation:**
    *   One star will be designated as "Earth." Its position can be fixed or randomly assigned (random is preferred for statistical consistency).
    *   The application will track and count the number of radio wave spheres that intersect the Earth star's position (a small, defined radius around the star's location). Intersection is considered a "hit."
* **Simulation Speed:** The simulation speed allows us to see faster the propagation of the waves. It must be set as x times the real speed.
* **Star Lifetime:** Refers to the time from star formation to its extinguishment.
*   **Simulation Duration:** The length of time the simulation will run, representing a period in years.
*   **Radio Signal Duration:** How long, in years, a star emits radio waves during its active period.

**4.2. Graphical User Interface (GUI) - Kivy**

*   **Input Fields:** The GUI will provide input fields (e.g., text boxes, sliders) for the following parameters, with clearly labeled units:
    *   **Galaxy Diameter (light-years):** Default: 1000
    *   **Total Number of Stars:** Default: 100
    *   **Number of Radio-Emitting Stars:** Default: (to be determined – suggest 10% of total stars as a starting point)
    *   **Simulation Speed (x times real speed):** Default: 10000
    *   **Average Star Lifetime (years):** Default: (to be determined – suggest 10 billion years as a starting point)
    *   **Simulation Duration (years):** Default: (to be determined – suggest 1 million years as a starting point)
    *   **Radio Signal Duration (years):** Default: (to be determined – suggest 100 years as a starting point)
    *   **Radio Civilization Lifetime (years):** Default: (to be determined – suggest 10,000 years as a starting point)
    *   **Percentage of Sky Covered by Radio Telescopes (%):** Default: (to be determined – suggest 0.0001% as a realistic starting point)
*   **Control Buttons:**
    *   **Start/Pause/Resume Simulation:** Controls the simulation execution.
    *   **Reset Simulation:** Resets the simulation to its initial state with the current input parameters.
*   **Display Area:**
    *   A 3D rendering area to visualize the galaxy, stars, and propagating radio waves.
    *   Stars should be represented as small, visible points (color can be used to distinguish radio-emitting stars).
    *   Radio waves should be represented as translucent spheres, expanding from their source stars.
    *   The "Earth" star should be clearly marked (e.g., with a different color or label).
*   **Summary Page/Display:** After the simulation completes (or is paused), a summary will be displayed, showing:
    *   **Total Radio Waves Detected at Earth:** The number of radio wave spheres that intersected the Earth star.
    *   **Estimated Probability of Detection:** Calculated based on the formula described in section 5.2.

**5. Non-Functional Requirements**

**5.1. Performance**

*   The simulation should run smoothly, without significant lag or stuttering, on a typical modern computer.
*   The GUI should be responsive to user input.
*   Memory usage should be reasonable and not lead to excessive memory consumption.

**5.2. Accuracy**

*   The random distribution of stars should be statistically sound.
*   The propagation of radio waves should accurately reflect the scaled speed of light.
*   The probability of detection calculation should be accurate, based on the following formula:

    ```
    Probability = (Radio Waves Detected / Total Simulation Duration) * (Radio Civilization Lifetime / Average Star Lifetime) * (Percentage of Sky Covered / 100)
    ```
    *Explanation:*
    *  `(Radio Waves Detected / Total Simulation Duration)`: Represents the frequency of radio wave hits at Earth.
    *  `(Radio Civilization Lifetime / Average Star Lifetime)`: Represents the probability that a radio-emitting civilization exists *concurrently* with Earth's listening period.
    *  `(Percentage of Sky Covered / 100)`: Represents the proportion of the sky our telescopes can observe.

**5.3. Usability**

*   The GUI should be intuitive and easy to use, even for users unfamiliar with the underlying concepts.
*   Clear labels and units should be provided for all input fields and displayed values.
*   Error messages (if any) should be informative and helpful.

**5.4. Maintainability**

*   The Python code should be well-structured, commented, and follow best practices for readability and maintainability.
*   The use of Kivy should follow Kivy's recommended coding style and structure.

**5.5 Technology Stack**

    * Programming Language: Python
    * GUI Framework: Kivy
    * 3D Rendering: Kivy's built-in 3D capabilities (or a suitable 3D library integrated with Kivy, if necessary, like a lightweight OpenGL wrapper).

**6. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for Initial Version)**

*   Different galaxy shapes (e.g., spiral arms).
*   Variable radio wave intensity.
*   More sophisticated star lifecycle models.
*   Networked simulations (multiple users).
*   Import/export of simulation data.
*   More detailed statistical analysis.

**7. Deliverables**

*   Source code (Python and Kivy)
*   Executable application (if feasible)
*   Basic user documentation (explaining how to use the application)

**8. Open Issues and Decisions**

*   **Precise default values:** Several default values (marked "to be determined") need to be finalized based on testing and balancing realism with visual appeal.
*   **3D Rendering Library:**  Determine whether Kivy's built-in 3D capabilities are sufficient or if a dedicated 3D library (e.g., a lightweight OpenGL wrapper) is needed.
*   **Earth Star Position:** Decide whether the "Earth" star's position should be fixed or randomly generated. (Random is preferred for a more statistically consistent result).
*  **Star Representation:** Determine the optimal visual representation of stars (size, color, shape) to balance visibility and performance.
* **Wave Intersection Calculation:** Determine a performant method to calculate the sphere-point intersection. A simple distance check between the Earth star's center and the sphere's center, compared to the sphere's radius, is sufficient.
* **Radio-emitting star interval** How to represent and simulate the interval of star's life where they emmit radio waves. A simple and clear option is to get a random year inside the star life and consider that interval to be +/- Radio signal Duration.

This document provides a comprehensive scope for the development of the radio wave propagation simulation application. It should serve as a guide for developers and stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.
